## Using Anaconda
Create a Focused Environment:
Open your terminal or Anaconda Prompt.
Run the following command to create a new conda environment named main-ds with Python 3.9:
```
conda create --name main-ds python=3.9
```
## Activate the environment to isolate your project's dependencies:
```
conda activate main-ds
```

## Just like in the Anaconda approach, use pip to install the packages listed in your requirements.txt file:
``
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Your Streamlit App:
Once you've set up your environment using either option, navigate to the directory where your Streamlit app code resides (e.g., the directory containing dashboard.py). Then, execute the following command to launch the app:
```
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
This command instructs Streamlit to run your Python script (dashboard.py) and present the interactive dashboard within your web browser. The exact URL will be displayed in the terminal
